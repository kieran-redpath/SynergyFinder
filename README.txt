Download "SynergyFinder.Rmd" and "SynergyFinderTemplate.xlsx", and put them in a folder you want to be your working directory.
Format your input data the same as SynergyFinderTemplate.xlsx.
Your data must have at least two replicates for the software to work properly.
Copy replicates underneath each other. As long as the number in the block_id column is the same for all replicates of a drug combo, the software will understand this. Input response data can be expressed as either inhibition, viability, or a proxy for these, as long as it's formatted as a percentage (rather than a decimal) relative to a control.
Open "SynergyFinder.Rmd" in RStudio and follow the instructions at the start of the document.
